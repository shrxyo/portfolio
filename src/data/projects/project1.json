  "dates": "January 2025 - May 2025",
  "technologies": [ "Python", "HuggingFace Transformers", "OpenAI API", "ChromaDB", "LLaMA 3.2"],

  "context": "A research-based multi-turn therapy assistant built using a hybrid generation pipeline that combined Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) to enhance emotional intelligence and memory retention in chatbot conversations.",
  "objectives": [
    "Built a chatbot capable of emotionally supportive, therapy-style dialogue",
    "Integrated RAG to retrieve past session summaries using ChromaDB",
    "Injected pre-validated therapeutic knowledge into context using CAG",
    "Compared open-source and API-based models under the same memory framework",
    "Evaluated models using semantic similarity and human-rated empathy scores"
  ],
  "features": [
    "Hybrid memory pipeline with both RAG and CAG integration",
    "Fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini on a multi-turn mental therapy dataset",
    "Implemented KV caching using LLaMA 3.2 1B Instruct for CAG",
    "Used ChromaDB with a context classifier to enable session recall",
    "Achieved 67.5% semantic similarity and a 4.5/5 expert-rated empathy score"
