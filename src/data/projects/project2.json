  "technologies": [ "Python", "Prompt Engineering", "OpenAI API", "LLMs" ],
  "context": "A research project focused on handling class imbalance in medical transcription datasets by generating synthetic data using Large Language Models and comparing their effectiveness against traditional augmentation methods.",
  "objectives": [
    "Augmented a highly imbalanced medical transcription dataset using LLMs like ClinicalBERT, ALBERT, GPT-Neo, and T5",
    "Generated approximately 800 synthetic samples to boost minority class representation",
    "Benchmarked LLM-based augmentation against SMOTE using two model architectures",
    "Trained and evaluated CNN and CNN+BiLSTM classifiers on the augmented datasets",
    "Demonstrated the effectiveness of domain-specific LLMs in improving minority class accuracy"
  ],
  "features": [
    "Domain-specific augmentation using ClinicalBERT and ALBERT",
    "Applied text-to-text generation and paraphrasing using T5 and GPT-Neo",
    "Implemented synonym replacement and strategic masking techniques",
    "Achieved 94% accuracy with ALBERT and 93% with ClinicalBERT on CNN classifiers",
    "Outperformed traditional SMOTE baseline which achieved only 53% accuracy"
